<h2 align="center"> Exploring Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities and Mitigations: <br>A Practical Analysis of Stack Cookies, DEP, and ASLR <br></h2>

<h3> Research </h3>

<i>Overview:</i> <br>
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities continue to pose a significant threat to software security. Security professionals have introduced various mitigations over the last two decades to enhance security and reduce the impact of buffer overflows. A few examples of these mitigations include Stack Cookies, Data Execution Prevention (DEP), and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). It is important to assess their effectiveness in practical scenarios as buffer overflows still remain a relevant threat. <br> <br>

<i>Problem Statement:</i> <br>
- How and to what extent do Stack Cookies, DEP, and ASLR mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities in real-world software applications, and what methods can attackers use potentially bypass them to exploit vulnerabilities? <br> <br>

<i>Research Objectives:</i> <br>
- Understand how Stack Cookies, DEP, and ASLR work to prevent buffer overflow exploits <br>
- Evaluate their mitigation effectiveness <br>
- Investigate potential techniques that attackers may use to bypass these mitigations <br>
- Develop practical demonstrations to illustrate these mitigations and the techniques used by attackers to bypass them <br> <br>
